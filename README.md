## 🖥 Interface (Terminal)

![fotoPreview](fotoPreview.png)

## 📃 Description
This is a simple **Python calculator** project that runs directly in the terminal. The goal is to practice basic language structures such as **functions**, **loops**, **control flow**, and **user input**.  

The calculator performs **addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division** between two numbers.

## 📌 Features

- ➕ Add two numbers  
- ➖ Subtract two numbers  
- ✖️ Multiply two numbers  
- ➗ Divide two numbers  
- 🚪 Exit the program  

## 🧠 Logic

- The program uses an **infinite loop** that displays a menu of operations to the user.  
- Each operation is executed by a specific function that takes two numbers and returns the result.  
- The loop continues until the user chooses to exit the program.  

## 📂 Code Structure

- Main functions:  
  - `add()`: adds two numbers  
  - `subtract()`: subtracts two numbers  
  - `multiply()`: multiplies two numbers  
  - `divide()`: divides two numbers  
- The main menu calls these functions according to the user's choice.  
- User input is handled via `input()` and results are displayed in the terminal.
